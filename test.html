# Stock Price Prediction Web App
![View of the Webapp Design](images/Webapp_photo.png)
## Introduction

This project aimed at creating machine learning models to predict whether the stock price for a given company would increase or decrease on a particular day. It is built on two random forest models and provides an interactive interface via a Flask web application for users to explore the predictions alongside valuable financial data.

## Features

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predictions on whether the stock price will increase or decrease.
- **Stock Selection**: Option to choose from one of 17 stock tickers that the models were trained on.
- **Stock Historical Data**: Graphs and displays stock information from the past 6 months using the Yahoo Finance API.
- **News Feed**: Scraped news articles related to the selected stock from the Finviz website.
- **Financial Information Display**: Retrieves and displays financial data of the selected company from the Alpha Vantage API, including ratio and technical analyses.

## Ratio/Technical Analysis
- Calculated from the Alpha Vantage API
### Earnings
- 52 Day high / 52 day low
- Diluted Earnings Per Share
- YOY Quarterly Rev Growth
- AlphaVantage Target Price (Used to compare against my own model's conclusions
### Profitability
- **Gross Margin**:
- **Return on Asset**:
- **Return on Equity**:
### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**:
- **Acid Test**:
### Solvency
- **Debt to Equity**:
- **Debt Ratio**:

## Technologies/APIs Used

- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest models.
- **Web Framework**: Flask.
- **APIs**: 
    - Alpha Vantage for financial information.
    - Yahoo Finance for historical stock data.
