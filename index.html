          I was a Boy Scout with Troop 284 for 8 years, and a Cub Scout before that. During my time I achieved the highest award in scouting, becoming an Eagle Scout. To do this I had to complete a project that would give back to my community. I chose two dugouts for the High School baseball team. After 3 years of preparation, over 500 cumulative man-hours, and $7,500, I had fundraised, prepared, and organized the project during the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. I take away not only the award, but an understanding of how to lead, and what it takes to complete a project.</div>

          I aged out when I turned 18 and could no longer be a scout. Now I am an active adult leader within the Troop. As a leader, I try to give back what I had gotten from the Troop and help upcoming Scouts achieve their goals of becoming Eagles, as well as giving back what I had learned as a scout to younger generations. </div>

          <div class="servicewords1"><!--Bio for Eagle Scout--> 
          Not only am I an active member of scouting, but I have also tried to give back in other ways as well. From freshmen year until I aged out at 18, I was a member of the Town of Babylon Youth Court. In this program, children who committed crimes could be sent to Youth Court to be tried by a jury of their peers. This is a rehabilitating program, and it was my job as the defense council to present my case in the defense of the defendant before a tribunal and jury (all consisting of youth members). I am grateful for that opportunity because of the skills that I receive in my pursuit to better myself and my community, I am able to apply to real-world applications, such as my internship with the DSNY legal department, an adult version of the Youth Court I participated in High School.</div>
